# Let's Get Help

On this seession we are going to talk about the main command with terraform help.

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# terraform --help
Usage: terraform [global options] <subcommand> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The primary workflow commands are given first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands.

Main commands:
  init          Prepare your working directory for other commands
  validate      Check whether the configuration is valid
  plan          Show changes required by the current configuration
  apply         Create or update infrastructure
  destroy       Destroy previously-created infrastructure
```

```init``` - What will happen when you enter init. 
Terraform supports 100+ prociders(gcp,aws,azure,etc). 

Terraform supports loading a resource from the respective provider when you use this command.

After adding your specific resource, use the terraform init command and check the steps what is happening.

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# cat resource.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2b"
  access_key = "youraccesskey"
  secret_key = "yoursecrectkey"
}
```

The initialization happening as per the resource provider. On my above file, used aws as a provider. You can change as per your need.
```
[root@terraform prodapp]# terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...    <============ aws service provider
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.54.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.54.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```


```validate``` - command will check the configuration like syntax check.

I have intentially modified the configuration on the below file for testing

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# cat resource.tf
provider "aws43" {  <========= wrongly updated the provider
  region = "us-west-2b"
  access_key = "youraccesskey"
  secret_key = "yoursecrectkey"
}
```

Terraform validated the file and throug the error. Hae, there are some errors identified in the file. Coudl you check?

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# terraform validate
╷
│ Error: Missing required provider
│
│ This configuration requires provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/awsi42, but that provider isn't available. You may be able to
│ install it automatically by running:
│   terraform init
╵
```

```plan``` - Once you completed your .tf code and you can execute and check what are the steps going to run without changing the infrastructure.

finally the ec2create.tf and resource.tf file has been updated with correct content.

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# cat ec2_create.tf
resource "aws_instance" "githubdemp" {
  ami = "ami-06e85d4c3149db26a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

[root@terraform prodapp]# cat resource.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "youraccesskey"
  secret_key = "yoursecrectkey"
}
```

The command will check the ami and instance type on the region. The ami which you are providing, should be available in the respective region.

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.

```apply```  -  Create or update infrastructure

The below output, ec2 has been created and Instance will be started and running fine on aws console.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

```

```destroy```  -   Destroy previously-created infrastructure

If you want to delete or destory the resource from the infrastructure you can use the destory command.

The command verified the current state of the infrastructure and using that state terraform will destory the resource.

```
[root@terraform prodapp]# terraform destroy

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.githubdump: Destroying... [id=i-02243484f90f5340b]
aws_instance.githubdump: Still destroying... [id=i-02243484f90f5340b, 10s elapsed]
aws_instance.githubdump: Still destroying... [id=i-02243484f90f5340b, 20s elapsed]
aws_instance.githubdump: Destruction complete after 29s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

That's it, you did a great job here.

Using real time time example we followed the terraform main commands.

1) ec2 instance created using terraform code.
2) destroyed the instance using terraform code.
3) all the stpes followed by terraform help main commands
