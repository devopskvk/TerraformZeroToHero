# Creating a EC2 instance using input variable values.

In my sample project i have taken a main.tf file which contains a resource block and what type of resource i am going to create.

For variable declaration we have to create a file name called variables.tf only. 

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# pwd
/opt/deployment
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# ll
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  97 Feb 12 13:49 main.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 138 Feb 12 13:39 resource.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 158 Feb 12 13:47 variables.tf
```

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# cat main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "githubdump"{
  ami           = var.ami
  instance_type = var.ins_type
}
```

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# cat variables.tf
variable "ec2_region"{
   default  = "us-west-2b"
}

variable "ami"{
  default      = "ami-06e85d4c3149db26a"
}

variable "ins_type"{
  default = "t2.nano"
}
```

Inintialized the resource

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.54.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

No errors on the files inside of the modules.

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 deployment]# terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

It shows the exact exection action without updating the infrastructure.

```

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```

Now applying the values using terraform apply command. which is going to create a ec2 instance as per our main.tf file.

After validation i am deleting the ec2 instance created by the terraform program.

```

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.githubdump: Destroying... [id=i-0ae446cf05ca05a45]
aws_instance.githubdump: Still destroying... [id=i-0ae446cf05ca05a45, 10s elapsed]
aws_instance.githubdump: Still destroying... [id=i-0ae446cf05ca05a45, 20s elapsed]
aws_instance.githubdump: Destruction complete after 29s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

That's it.

You have done a great Job. You created a resource using input variable values.

Will see on next class with output value example.
