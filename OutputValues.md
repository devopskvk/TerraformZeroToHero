# Attributes and outputs

On this example we are creating the ec2 instance using the arguments and displaying the values using the attributes.
```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 output]# pwd
/opt/output
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 output]# ll
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  109 Feb 12 17:37 main.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   74 Feb 12 17:35 output.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  138 Feb 12 16:47 resource.tf
```

On the below main.tf file have ami and instance_type will be there, these are called the arguments.

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 output]# cat main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "terraformdemo"{
        ami = "ami-06e85d4c3149db26a"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

ami, instance_type -> arguments

on the below output.tf file have a attributes which is gathering the values of resource which is created.

```
[root@ip-172-31-16-105 output]# cat output.tf
output "aws_ec2_pub_ip" {
 value = aws_instance.terraformdemo.public_ip  
}
```

#### aws_instance.terraformdemo.public_ip - attributes


Simple text: 
#### arguments are passing the values when creating a resource.      
#### attributes are gathering the values from created resource.

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  - aws_ec2_pub_ip = "34.219.117.44" -> null

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.terraformdemo: Destroying... [id=i-01400d38b48d3884c]
aws_instance.terraformdemo: Still destroying... [id=i-01400d38b48d3884c, 10s elapsed]

aws_instance.terraformdemo: Destruction complete after 40s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```


Great, You did a good job.

On next we can learn about how to pass the output value as a input to other resource.
